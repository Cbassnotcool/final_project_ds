## Section 1. Introduction

The purpose of this project is to explore forest data of my favorite country, Japan.

The three main points we are going to explore are
- Forest Area
- Number of Trees
- Percentage of land covered by forest

The plan is to use the following packages


**library(tidyverse)** <br>
**library(ggplot2)** <br>
**library(scales)** <br>
**loibrary(lubridate)** <br>
**library(plotly)** <br>
**library(ggthemes)** <br>
**library(extrafont)** <br>
**library(ggpubr)** <br>
