## Introduction


The purpose of this project is to explore forest data of my favorite country, Japan.

The three main points we are going to explore are
- Forest Area
- Number of Trees
- Percentage of land covered by forest

## Prerequisites

```{r message=FALSE. warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)
```

##Dataset

Import and proess data, which can be found
[here](https://github.com/Cbassnotcool/final_project_ds.git)

```{r}
percentage_of_land_covered_by_forest$`Forest cover` <- round(percentage_of_land_covered_by_forest$`Forest cover`, digits = 2 )
print(percentage_of_land_covered_by_forest)
```

```{r}
graph_forest <- percentage_of_land_covered_by_forest %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Forest cover`, text=paste("% of land covered in forests:", `Forest cover`)))+
  geom_point(color="#3e8235")+
  labs( title = "Percentage of land covered by forest",
        subtitle = "How much forest is there in Japan",
        x = "Year",
        y = "Percentage of land covered by forest"
          ) 

graph_forest
```

```{r}
forest_area_km <- forest_area_km
print(forest_area_km)
```

```{r}
graph_forest_2 <- forest_area_km %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = km_of_land))+
  geom_point(color="#3e8235")+
  labs( title = "Japan's Forests in Hectares",
        subtitle = "How much forest is there in Japan (KM)",
        x = "Year",
        y = "Hectares of forests"
          ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)


```

```{r}
graph_forest_23
```

Number of trees by year 

```{r}
number_of_trees <- number_of_trees
print(number_of_trees)
```
Since we know Japan has this many trees 18.616.717.312	we can estimate this the number of trees that has been lost per year

```{r}
total_lost_trees <- ((18616717312)*0.562923941811662)
print(total_lost_trees)
```

Now we can estimate the number of trees lost throughout the 120 years span in japan

```{r}
trees_lost_per_year <- total_lost_trees/120
print(trees_lost_per_year)
```

## Data Analisys 

Coming back to the Data analysis questions. We can display the answers in different forms. considering the prior results

- How much forest is there in Japan by percent of land covered? <br>

- How much forest is there in Japan by hectares? <br>

- How many trees has been losst in Japan, and how many tress has been lost per year in Japan
